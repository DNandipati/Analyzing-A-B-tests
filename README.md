# Project Title
Analyze A/B Test Results

# Description
Analyzing data and conducting A/B tests to determine if a web page change can attract more customers for an e-commerce website. 

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- StatsModels
- Scipy
- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Findings
- The findings shown that newer page implementation does not affect the user conversion rate 
and that the e-commerce website should not invest in making a new page.
- Analyzing data with countries of user did not impact the data as the p-value still remained to be
greater than the alpha value. We failed to reject our null hypothesis.
